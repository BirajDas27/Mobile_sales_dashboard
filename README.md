## 🔍 Project Overview

The raw dataset was initially **dirty and unstructured**, so I used **Power Query** to clean and transform it. The data showcases mobile phone sales, quantities, ratings, and transaction patterns across different models and time frames.

This dashboard was developed to present these insights in an interactive and accessible format using **Power BI Desktop**.
